            <p>As a Microsoft Student Partner , I meet alot of students in meetups , Hackathons and technical events. Most of them have a common question <q><cite> how to become a MSP and where to start from??</cite></q></p>
            <p> In colleges we generally don't havemuch exposure about the outside world , we dont know what's happening in industry so my request to everyone is join a tech community related to a field of your interest or may be a student community like
                MSP. Community has helped me to improve my personality , networks , learnings and skills. web developer . It has given me a lot of exposure to the outside world</p>
            <p>I'll be sharing my experience with you in this blog </p>
